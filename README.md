## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (first time)
- Flex properties
- Javascript form validations


### Continued development

Just want to keep going with my studies in front-end, until today, I'm learning HTML, CSS (SCSS today) and JS. Next step is to learn React JS and React Native.


### Useful resources

- [SatckOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-to-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) - This helped me with the regex function that returns the email validation.
